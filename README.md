## Overview

This project provides a hands-on introduction to TCP and UDP socket programming within a client-server paradigm. The primary functionality is string reversal: a client sends a string to the server over a network, and the server returns its reverse.

The communication follows a two-stage process:
1. **🛠️ Negotiation Stage**: Through the server's fixed negotiation port (`<n_port>`), the client and server determine a random port (`<r_port>`) for subsequent data transfer.
2. **✅ Transaction Stage**: Actual data transfer happens where the client connects using the negotiated `<r_port>`.

## Running the Program

### 🛠️ Setting up the Server
1. Navigate to the project's `source` directory on your server machine:
    ```bash
    cd ./source
    ```
2. Start the server by entering:
    ```bash
    python server.py <n_port> <req_code>
    ```
    Where:
    - **🔹 `<n_port>`**: The TCP negotiation port number.
    - **🔹 `<req_code>`**: The request code against which the client's requests will be verified.

### 🛠️ Setting up the Client
1. Navigate to the project's `source` directory on your client machine:
    ```bash
    cd ./source
    ```
2. Start the client by entering:
    ```bash
    python client.py <server_address> <n_port> <req_code> <msg>
    ```
    Where:
    - **🔹 `<server_address>`**: The server's address (e.g., "ubuntu2004-008.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca" or "ubuntu2004-008").
    - **🔹 `<n_port>`**: The TCP negotiation port for server communication.
    - **🔹 `<req_code>`**: The client's request code for negotiation.
    - **🔹 `<msg>`**: The string that you'd like the server to reverse.

> **💡 Note**: If the request codes on both the client and server match, the client sends the message to the server and receives its reverse.
